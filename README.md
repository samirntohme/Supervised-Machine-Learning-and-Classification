# Supervised-Machine-Learning-and-Classification
Stanford’s University ML specialization

This repository contains the files from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization

Topics covered:

Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Gradient Descent

More specifically, the files cover the following:
• Implement and visualize a cost function
• Implement gradient descent
• Optimize a regression model using gradient descent
• Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression
• Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training
• Implement linear regression
• Use logistic regression for binary classification
• Implement logistic regression for binary classification
• Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance
