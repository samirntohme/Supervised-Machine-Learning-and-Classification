# Supervised-Machine-Learning-and-Classification
Stanford’s University ML specialization

This repository contains the files from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization

**Topics covered:** <br>
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning <br>
Linear Regression <br>
Logistic Regression <br>
Gradient Descent <br>

**The files implement the following topics:** <br>
• Implement and visualize a cost function <br>
• Implement gradient descent <br>
• Optimize a regression model using gradient descent <br>
• Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression <br>
• Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training <br>
• Implement linear regression <br>
• Use logistic regression for binary classification <br>
• Implement logistic regression for binary classification <br>
• Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance <br>

**Running the Jupyter Notebook Files**
To run the .ipynb files in this repository, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
Python (>=3.7 recommended)
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

Installation
