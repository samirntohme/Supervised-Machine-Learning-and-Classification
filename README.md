# Supervised-Machine-Learning-and-Classification
Stanford’s University ML specialization

This repository contains the files from Stanford University's Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification course, of the Machine Learning specialization.

**Topics covered:** <br>
Supervised and Unsupervised Learning <br>
Linear Regression <br>
Logistic Regression <br>
Gradient Descent <br>

**The files implement the following topics:** <br>
• Implement and visualize a cost function <br>
• Implement gradient descent <br>
• Optimize a regression model using gradient descent <br>
• Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression <br>
• Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training <br>
• Implement linear regression <br>
• Use logistic regression for binary classification <br>
• Implement logistic regression for binary classification <br>
• Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance <br>

**Running the Jupyter Notebook Files** <br>
To run the .ipynb files make sure you have the prerequisites and then follow the installation steps. <br>

Prerequisites: <br>
Make sure you have the following installed on your system: <br>
Python (>=3.7 recommended) <br>
Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab <br>

Installation: <br>
1. Clone the repository (if not already done): <br>
git clone <repository_url> <br>
cd <repository_name> <br>

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended): <br>
python -m venv venv <br>
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux <br>
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows <br>

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook: <br>
jupyter notebook <br>

This will open Jupyter in your default web browser. Navigate to the directory containing the .ipynb files and open the desired notebook. <br>

Alternative: Run in Jupyter Lab (optional, if installed): <br>
jupyter lab
